# Facebook Group to WordPress

A simple plugin that imports posts from facebook groups to your WordPress blog, hourly!

## What it does & doesn't

* Imports from facebook group and inserts as `fb_group_post` post type
* No chance for duplication
* It doesn't import comments
* Runs hourly via WordPress cron system
* Doesn't import historical posts yet
* Adds group id, author name and ID, post link as post meta

## Room for improvements

* Import comments too
* Import historical (paginated) posts
